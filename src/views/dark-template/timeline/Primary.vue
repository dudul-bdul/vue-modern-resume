                    I'm still emotional about this one. It was August 9, 2009 that I decided to start blogging so <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090819185659/http://an7.mahblog.com/">an7.mahblog.com</a> has just showed up! Years later, Mahblog.com got censored in Iran and my blog disappeared. <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120626234739/http://www.an7.mahblog.com/">Last archived page</a> was on June 26, 2012.

                <p>
                    Back then, my blog used to get more than 500 visitors/day and its Page Rank has reached to level 2 which was actually great! Rest In Peace an7 ...

                <p>
                    During 2009 - 2011, many other blogs has been created too. For example:

            The reason I founded Delix.ir (<u>D</u>ocument <u>ELIXIR</u>) was because back in school, I found out that there is an unsolved need for this kind of services especially needed by teachers. However, it wasn't developed since 2017.

            Currently, 3330+ people are using the service. It's still under development and we're going to change the strategy to support B2B market soon.

          This awesome year was a turning point in my life. I found out the reason why my businesses are not growing; what I'm doing wrong; what I've supposed to do and plenty of other thoughts.

          Technically, I got familiar with and tried to be best (not yet of course!) at the following technologies:
